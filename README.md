# Restaurant Review
> One-page application to review restaurants in NYC



This was done as the final project for the Udacity Front End Nano-Degree program.
Run the application on your local server to get reviews on restaurants around
NYC, admire the responsive design, close your eyes (and mouse) and navigate
all content with your screen reader, or go off-line and see how the service worker
keeps the app working just the same (as long as you've visited once before).

## Installation - from the command line, using node.js

1) install the server program by entering
npm i -g http-serve

2) get your computer running the project directory by entering
cd *path here* - for example c:\\users\\user\\github\\restaurant-reviews

3) The command line will tell you where it's running the website. Open your browser and, in the address bar, enter
localhost:*port number here* - for example localhost:8000
